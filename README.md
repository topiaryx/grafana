If you're like me, you want to set up Grafana and have it looking nice and pretty, but you just don't know where to start and there are too many guides that are not very detailed or just don't have the right information. I've created this guide to attempt to resolve that issue by making this extremely easy and straight forward, as well as by putting as much detail in to the process as I can. 

This project was originally started by me, but since has since had some awesome contributions from great people in the community!
